Basic description for Jira workflow:

>Open ！ This issue is in the initial 'Open' state, ready for the assignee to start work on it.
>In Progress ！ This issue is being actively worked on at the moment by the assignee.
>Resolved ！ A Resolution has been identified or implemented, and this issue is awaiting verification by the reporter. From here, issues are either 'Reopened' or are 'Closed'.
>Reopened ！ This issue was once 'Resolved' or 'Closed', but is now being re-examined. 
             (For example, an issue with a Resolution of 'Cannot Reproduce' is Reopened when more information becomes               
              available and the issue becomes reproducible). 
             From here, issues are either marked In Progress, Resolved or Closed. 
>Closed ！ This issue is complete.
